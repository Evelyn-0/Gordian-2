NOTE:
- linking number for links still doesnt quite match Gordian 1

Note 3/27
- run alg_walk_thru and note that a_2 is 1.5 for a cycle
- this is because crossing_data_for_links is being 0 somewhere it's not supposed to be
    - two disjoint cycles result in linking number of 0 or 1 or -1 when divided by 2, never an odd number

Note 4/2:
- alg_walk_thru still invalid from 3/27
- realized: when crossings are reoriented, does their order also need to be reoriented? I THINK YES
