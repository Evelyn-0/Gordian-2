NOTE:
- linking number for links still doesnt quite match Gordian 1

Note 3/27
- run alg_walk_thru and note that a_2 is 1.5 for a cycle
- this is because crossing_data_for_links is being 0 somewhere it's not supposed to be
    - two disjoint cycles result in linking number of 0 or 1 or -1 when divided by 2, never an odd number

Note 4/2:
- alg_walk_thru still invalid from 3/27 - SOLVED
- realized: when crossings are reoriented, does their order also need to be reoriented? I THINK YES
- order_matters broke -- but i think i got closer with knotting overall. order_matters was right for wrong reason.

Note 4/2:
- revisit new order_matters (try to run on original Gordian to see answer)
- Problems:
    - (SOLVED) crossing_data_for_knots not being reset between cycles (PROBLEM), going to assume crossing_data_for_links not being reset either
    - returning too many knots now:
        - something to do with seen/not seen
            - if we pass over an over crossing, do we mark it as seen (I THINK SO -- see "Knotting algorithm" notability)
        - could also be the order of crossings (more likely)
            - does changing the orientation of the knots also change order (I THINK SO -- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
            - go thru order_matters and check everything

Note 4/3:
- order_matters is now order_matters_new
- order_matters_old is an old example where there exists no knot, one cycle
    - inspecting this:
    - WORKS (NOT KNOTTED)
- order_matters_new is running correctly, 8 knots
    - checked each cycle given by the program, and each knot with a shoestring. everything checks out.
